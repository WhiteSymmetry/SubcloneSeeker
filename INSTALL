Installation
============

SubcloneSeeker distributes in the format of source code. You can compile and
install it on your platform with relative ease since it the project is managed
by GNU autotools. 

Requirement
-----------

In order to successfully compile the project, you will need no more than a
working c++ compiler on a Unix / Linux system. In order to build the
documentation, you will then need Doxygen installed at places where its binary
can be found in PATH environment variable. 

Compile
-------

Like any other project that is under the management of GNU autotools, you
perform the following from the project's source tree:

	./configure
	make

If you like to run the test suite, execute the following

	make test

These are unit tests to ensure the correctness of the source code. They would
come in handy if you want to modify the source code

Installation
------------

All the command-line utilities will be found in the 'utils' directory. They can
be run directly from there, or should you choose to, be installed into your
system (usually defaults to /usr/local/bin) with the following command

	make install

This will also install the statically compiled SubcloneSeeker core library
libss.a into /usr/local/lib

Uninstall
---------

Simply execute

	make uninstall

From the source tree to uninstall the binaries from your system
