Installation
============

SubcloneSeeker distributes in the format of source code. You can compile and
install it on your platform with relative ease since the project is managed by
GNU autotools. 

Requirement
-----------

In order to successfully compile the project, you will need no more than a
working c++ compiler on a Unix / Linux system. For generating the
documentation, you will, in addition, need Doxygen installed at places where
its binary can be found in PATH environment variable. 

Getting the source code
-----------------------

The latest release of SubcloneSeeker is 1.0, which can be downloaded at
https://github.com/yiq/SubcloneSeeker

Compile
-------

Like any other project that is under the management of GNU autotools, you
perform the following from the project's source tree:

	./configure
	make

If you like to run the test suite, execute the following

	make test

These are unit tests to ensure the correctness of the source code. They would
come in handy if you want to modify the source code

Note: The project does not support VPATH build yet. It needs to be built in the
source tree directly

Installation
------------

All the command-line utilities will be created in the 'utils' directory. They
can be run directly from there, or should you choose to, be installed into your
system (usually defaults to /usr/local/bin) with the following command

	make install

This will also install the statically compiled SubcloneSeeker core library
libss.a into /usr/local/lib

Uninstall
---------

Simply execute

	make uninstall

from the source tree to uninstall the binaries from your system
